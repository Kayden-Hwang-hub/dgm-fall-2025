## 1. What CNNs Can Do

### Image Classification
**Definition:** Assigning a single label to an entire image from a set of predefined categories.  

**Key Characteristics:**
- Input: Entire image
- Output: Single class label with confidence score
- Question Answered: "What is the main object in this image?"

**Examples:**

- Classifying an image as "cat" vs "dog"
- Identifying handwritten digits (0-9)
- Medical image diagnosis (normal vs abnormal)

<br>

### Object Detection
**Definition:** Identifying and localizing multiple objects within an image, including their positions and classifications.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Input: Entire image
- Output: Multiple bounding boxes + class labels
- Question Answered: "What objects are where in this image?"

**Examples:**
- Detecting cars, trucks, pedestrians in autonomous driving
- Finding faces and facial features in photos
- Inventory counting in retail

<br>

### Object Segmentation
**Definition:** Pixel-level classification where each pixel in the image is assigned to a specific object category.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Input: Entire image
- Output: Pixel-wise mask with class labels
- Question Answered: "Which pixels belong to which objects?"

**Types of Segmentation:**
1. Semantic Segmentation:
   - Labels each pixel with a class
   - Doesn't distinguish between object instances
   - Example: All "car" pixels get same label

2. Instance Segmentation:
   - Identifies and separates individual object instances
   - Example: Differentiates between car1, car2, car3

**Examples:**
- Medical imaging (tumor boundary detection)
- Autonomous driving (road, pedestrian, vehicle segmentation)
- Photo editing tools (background removal)
