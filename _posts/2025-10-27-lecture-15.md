## 1.Generative Models

### Deep Generative Models (DGM)

**Key Characteristics**
  - Previoulsy, we learned about discriminative model that can classify images (e.g., CNN).
  - Now, we will learn generative models that not only classify images, but they can also generate them on their own - such as ChatGPT, Gemini or DeepSeek.

## 2. Generative and Discriminative Models

### More detail about difference between two Models
**1. Generative Models**
  - Models focus on learning the underlying distribution of the data
  - aim to understand how the data is generated, so allows them to create new data
  - Models the joint distribution $P(X,Y)$ where $X$ represents the features Y denotes the class labels

**2. Descriminative Models**
  - Models focus on modeling and decision boundary between classes
  - learn conditional distribution $P(Y \mid X)$ which represents the probability of a class label given the input features 
  - used for classification tasks or distinguishing between classes based on features

**3. Two paths to P(Y|X)**

**Descriminative Models**
  - Direct path
  - When you observe X, Y then you directly learn $P(Y \mid X)$ which is the boundary between classes
  - $P(Y \mid X)$ is, "Given X(data), what is the most likely Y(label)
  - In classification, $\hat{Y} = argmax_Y P(Y \mid X)$

**Generative Models**
  - Observe (X, Y)
  - you first learn:
    - $P(X \mid Y)$ → how data X is distributed within each class
    - $P(Y)$ → Distribution of Y (the prior)
  - also you can calculate $P(X) = \int_{Y} P(X,Y) \ dY$ which is the marginal probability of X regardless of Y
  - finally we yield $P(Y \mid X)$ using bayes' rule
    - $P(Y \mid X) = \frac{P(X \mid Y) \, P(Y)}{P(X)}$
  - In classification task, we don't need to calculate $P(X)$
    - $\hat{Y} = argmax_Y P(X \mid Y) \ P(Y)$

## 3. Example Discriminative Model:Logistic Regression
**Core Characteristic of Discriminative Model:** Parameterization
- Parameterization in Logistic Regression
  - $P(Y = 1 \mid X) = \sigma(\theta^{T} \ X)$, where $\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$ is the sigmoid function
  - $P(Y = 0 \mid X) = 1 - P(Y=1 \mid X)$
  - "Why do we choose this form of parameterization?"
  - Because in logistic regression, we **assume the log-odds of the probability is a linear function of the input**

   - In logistic regression the log odds is a linear combination of the features X
   - Estimate $\hat{\theta}$ form observation:

## 4. Example Generative Model: Naive Bayes
**Core Characteristic of Generative Model:**

We observe X and Y. Then we learn $P(X \mid Y) and P(Y)$ and we use it to derive $P(Y \mid X) = \frac{P(X \mid Y) P(Y)}{P(X)}$, where $P(Y = 1) = \frac{number \hspace{1em} of \hspace{1em} samples \hspace{1em} with \hspace{1em} Y = K}{Total \hspace{1em} samples}$
- Parameterize
  - Assume $P(X \mid Y) = \prod_{j=1}^{d} P(X_j \mid Y)$
  - $P(X_j \mid Y) = N (\mu_{jk} , \sigma_{jk}^{2})$
- Estimate
  - $\hat{\mu} , \hat{\sigma} = argmax_{\mu , \sigma} P(X \mid Y)$
- Calculate
  - $P(Y=1 \mid X) = \frac{\prod_{j=1}^{d} P(X_j \mid Y) P(Y=1)}{P(X)}$
 
## MAP / Regularization Note:

Logistic regression: 
We change our $\hat{\theta}$ estimates from observations by:

## 5. Discriminative vs Generative Models

- Discriminative models optimize the conditional likelihood:
$\hat{\theta_{disc}} = argmax_{\theta} P(Y \mid X; \theta) = argmax_{\theta} \frac{P(X \mid Y ; \theta) P(Y; \theta)}{P(X; \theta)}$
- Generative models optimize the joint likelihood:
$\hat{\theta_{disc}} = argmax_{\theta} P(X, Y; \theta) = argmax_{\theta} P(X \mid Y ; \theta) P(Y; \theta)$

  This means they are exactly the same optimization when $P(X; \theta)$ is invariant to $\theta$

## 6. Logistic Regression vs Naive Bayes

### Logistic Regression**
- **Type** : Discriminative
- It directly models the decision boundary: $P(Y \mid X; \theta)$
- It does **not** models how data is generated only the probability that a given \(X\) belongs to a certain class \(Y \)
- Defines : $P(Y \mid X; \theta) = \sigma(\theta^T X) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\theta^T X}}$
- Estimates:
  - Parameters are learned by maximizing the conditional likelihood: $\hat{\theta_{lr}} = argmax_{\theta} P(Y \mid X; \theta)$
  - Or equivalently, by maximizing the **log-likelihood**:
    $\hat{\theta_{lr}} = \arg\max_{\theta} \sum_i \left[Y_i \log \sigma(\theta^{T} X_i) + (1 - Y_i) \log \left(1 - \sigma(\theta^{T} X_i)\right)\right]$
- Properties:
  - **Lower asymptotic error** : As the sample size approaches infinity, the learned boundary becomes optimal and the error rate decreases.
  - **Slower convergence** : Requires more data to achieve stable performance because it learns only from discriminative information.


<br>

### Naive Bayes
- **Type** : Generative
  - Learns the **joint distribution** of data $P(X, Y; \theta) = P(Y; \theta) \cdot P(X \mid Y; \theta)$
  - Using Bayes' rule, we can derive the posterior: $P(Y \mid X) = \frac{P(X \mid Y) \, P(Y)}{P(X)}$
- Assumption: **Conditional independence assumption**
  $$P(X \mid Y) = \prod_{j=1}^{d} P(X_j \mid Y)$$
- Estimates: Parameters are learned by maximizing the **joint likelihood**: $\hat{\theta}_{NB} = \arg\max_\theta P(X, Y; \theta)$
- Properties:
  - **Higher asymptotic error** : Because the independence assumption is not always true, it can produce biased estimates when data features are correlated
  - **Faster convergence** : Simpler assumptions mean fewer parameters, allowing it to learn well even from small datasets

### Discriminative vs Generative: A proposition
- **“While discriminative learning has lower asymptotic error, a generative classifier may also approach its (higher) asymptotic error much faster.”**
- This statement compares the **learning efficiency** and **error behavior** of  **discriminative** vs **generative** models
- Underlying Assumption :
  - **Generative models** of the form $P(X, Y; \theta)$ make **more simplifying assumptions** than **discriminative models** of the form $P(Y \mid X; \theta)$
  - These assumptions often allow faster convergence (fewer samples needed), but may lead to **higher asymptotic error** due to bias in modeling
  - However, it is **not always true** In some data distributions, discriminative and generative approaches can perform similarly, or even the opposite may occur, depending on model misspecification

## 7. Modern Deep Generative Models (DGMs)
- Goal : To design **generative models** of the form $$P(X, Y; \theta)$$ that can model complex data distributions **without making overly strong simplifying assumptions**.
- Key Idea : Hidden Structure \( z \): Deep generative models introduce a **latent (hidden) variable \( z \)** that captures the underlying structure of high-dimensional observations \( x \)
  - \( z \) explains or encodes meaningful patterns in the data  
  - \( x \) is generated from \( z \) through a probabilistic process, e.g. $p_\theta(x|z)$
  - But we **never directly observe** the latent variable \(z \)
  - Because of this, **two key computations become difficult**:
    - 1. **Marginal likelihood** : $p_\theta(x) = \int p_\theta(x, z)\,dz$
We must integrate over all possible latent variables \( z \), which is intractable in high-dimensional space
    - 2. **Posterior inference** : $p_\theta(z \mid x) \propto p_\theta(x \mid z)\,p(z)$. The posterior distribution of \( z \) given \( x \) is typically complex and cannot be computed analytically.
    - 3. Each type of **Deep Generative Model (DGM)** makes a **tradeoff** between: **Expressiveness** (how flexible the model is) and **Computational tractability** (how easy it is to compute or train)
